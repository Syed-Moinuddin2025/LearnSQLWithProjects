# 🔁 Python Loops Practice – 03_loops

This folder contains Python programs and practice problems based on **loops** (`for`, `while`) and iteration logic. These are designed to help beginners build a strong understanding of loop-based programming.

---

## 🧠 What You'll Practice

- Looping with `for` and `while`
- Working with strings and numbers
- Using `break`, `continue`, and loop logic
- Input validation and nested loops
- Real-world loop-based exercises
